Additional Features
For Project 2, my additional features I have added is disabling the old movie genre category in the edit event page, so that a new category would be selected when editing to avoid confusion.
Progress & Challenges
-	The status of Project 2 at this point is complete. I have no remaining portions to complete for this assignment, so consider this submission as complete and valid. I had very few issues with Bootstrap but I managed to fix them when I realized my forms were missing the enctype to upload images using the Multer package.
-	The easy parts of the assignment was creating the converting the HTML pages to EJS templates, but the most difficult part was building the controllers, routes, and models, but it was done with perseverance and I am glad I am finis
